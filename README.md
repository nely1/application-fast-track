# Welcome to the Github page for NES

We are a small team of 3 students doing a project for the CISSA SummerHack 2024

### Project Background
We built a web application called Application Fast Track which is used by companies to review resumes sent by applicants. The application aims to not hinder the work process of the recruiter while also helping applicants with their job search journey to lead them to less confusion in writing their resumes.

### Our Goals
The broad goal of this project is to make the application process for graduates applying for jobs less terrifying. We aim to streamline the application process, thereby eliminating the uncertainty of the current application status and allowing us to learn from application rejections.

Our sub-goals for this project are: 
1. Learn about Next.js
2. Build an (idealistically) useful app that will help us when apply for jobs 
3. Play around with OpenAI or Google API
4. Most importantly, enjoy coding!
