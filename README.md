### Our Goals
The broad goal of this project is to make the application process for graduates applying for jobs less terrifying. We aim to streamline the application process, thereby eliminating the uncertainty of the current application status and allowing us to learn from application rejections.

Our sub-goals for this project are: 
1. Learn about Next.js
2. Build an (idealistically) useful app that will help us when apply for jobs 
3. Play around with OpenAI or Google API
4. Most importantly, enjoy coding!
